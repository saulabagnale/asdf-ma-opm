He decides to put his new skill to good use by becoming a hero. However, he quickly becomes bored with easily defeating monsters, and wants someone to give him a challenge to bring back the spark of being a hero.Upon bearing witness to Saitama\'s amazing power, Genos, a cyborg, is determined to become Saitama\'s apprentice. During this time, Saitama realizes he is neither getting the recognition that he deserves nor known by the people due to him not being a part of the Hero Association. Wanting to boost his reputation, Saitama decides to have Genos register with him, in exchange for taking him in as a pupil. Together, the two begin working their way up toward becoming true heroes, hoping to find strong enemies and earn respect in the process.","genres":"Action, Comedy, Sci-Fi, Slice of Life, Superhero","themes":"Aliens, Animals, Martial Arts, Monster Girls, Monsters, Supernatural, Gore","uploadDate":1604099164325}')}}]);
